## Note for Developers

IWI is being developed in double-precision, mono-enabled Godot (4.3-stable). As such, you will need to build Godot from source in order to edit this project. I recommend following the [official guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html) for this.

Remember to build with double-precision and mono enabled, as well as to generate the C# bindings.
