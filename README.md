<h3>Note for Developers</h3>

IWI is being developed in double-precision Godot. As such, you will need to build Godot from source in order to edit this project. I recommend following the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html">official guide</a> for this.

Remember to build with double-precision and mono enabled, as well as to generate the C# bindings.
