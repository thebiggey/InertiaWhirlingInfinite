The plan is to rewrite the planet code with C++ and GLSL, once I've learned some more of it. This code will have to be fast, and I think it'll be good practice.

So this is what it will hopefully work like:

The planetary terrain is generated by a cubesphere. Each face is then subdivided into a predetermined amount of quads. Each of these quads are treated as their own seperate entity.

They each hold their part of the heightmap, which is usually saved in RAM (at multiple lod levels). These quads are indexed based on their face and position.
